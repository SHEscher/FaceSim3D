## Project description

To test the effect of space and time on face similarity judgments,
we conducted an online experiment using a triplet odd-one-out task
in a static 2D and a dynamic 3D condition.
We then trained sparse and deep computational encoding models of human face similarity judgments
to investigate the latent representations that underlie their predictions.

## Analysis of face similarity judgments in 2D and 3D

`code/` contains the code for data quality control, preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.

### Research code `facesim3d` as Python package

The code for data quality control, preprocessing, modeling and further analysis
is available as the Python package `facesim3d`.
The package has been implemented in `Python 3.10.4` (no other versions have been tested).

Ideally, create a virtual environment (e.g., `conda`) to install the package:

```shell
conda create -n face_3.10 python=3.10.4
```

Activate the environment:

```shell
conda activate face_3.10
```

#### Install the package

```shell
# Go to root folder of FaceSim3D
cd FaceSim3D/
pip install -e .
```

Two computational models (SPosE, VICE) that were used require additional packages
that can be installed with the following command:

```shell
pip install -e ".[spose,vice]"
```

## Experiment: Face similarity judgments in 2D and 3D
Participants had the task to identify the dissimilar face out of three faces in a triplet odd-one-out task.

`experiment/` contains the code for the experimental setup.
The experiment is based on [`UXF 2.0`](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework),
and `Unity`.

## Results

Results are summarized in form of a Jupyter notebook in `code/notebooks/`.
Additionally, some of the analysis outputs are stored in the folder `results/`.

## Research data

*Link to the research data will be offered soon.*

To reproduce the analysis, the data should be stored in the `data/` folder.
