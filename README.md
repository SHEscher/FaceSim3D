To test the effect of space and time on face similarity judgements, we conducted an online experiment using a triplet odd-one-out task in a static 2D and a dynamic 3D condition. We then trained sparse and deep computational encoding models of human face similarity judgements to investigate the latent representations that underlie their predictions.
